# Drowsiness Detection System

This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using Python, OpenCV, and dlib. The system monitors a driver's face through a webcam and detects signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure and yawning. It uses facial landmarks to calculate the eye aspect ratio (EAR) and mouth aspect ratio (MAR) to determine the driver's alertness level.
